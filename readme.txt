2- Machine Learning (Mushroom prediction)
It is third program of machine learning series written by me for those who really really try to understand what happens there. 
The program employs a Decision Tree Classifier, a type of machine learning algorithm, trained on a dataset of mushrooms to make predictions.
Dataset: Past mushroom information as csv format 
Preprocessing: Label Encoding have been applied to transform categorical data into a numerical format suitable for the machine learning model.

Goal:  predict the nature of mushrooms based on select features. However, always exercise caution when it comes to actual mushroom consumption, as no prediction tool can guarantee 100% accuracy. 

Program reads a dataset using pandas. Raw data is converted to numeric values using "LabelEncoder" and data split into training and test sets. 
Scikit librariery are used. 
Program has 2 versions. the first is text based version printing out data on the console and show confusion matrix and decision tree individually. The graphic based version uses Tkinter and allows user see past data. 
I tried to explain program with comments but feel free to ask what we did here.
